# TPS Node TSPL

This project is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing and executing tasks using both C++ and Node.js. It includes a variety of services and utilities to streamline development and deployment processes.

## Compiling C++ Code

To compile the C++ code, use the following command:

```sh
g++ -o output_executable source_file.cpp
```

Replace `output_executable` with the desired name of your compiled program and `source_file.cpp` with the name of your C++ source file.

## Running Node.js Code

To execute the Node.js code, use the following command:

```sh
node your_script.js
```

Replace `your_script.js` with the name of your Node.js script file.

## Example: PrinterService.ts

Below is an example of how the `PrinterService.ts` might look in a project:

```typescript
// filepath: /path/to/your/project/PrinterService.ts
export class PrinterService {
    print(message: string): void {
        console.log(message);
    }
}

// Usage example
const printer = new PrinterService();
printer.print("Hello, world!");
```
